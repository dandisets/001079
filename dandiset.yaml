description: We have extracted, curated using field standards, and shared over 2,054,021
  SWR events from 258 mice from these datasets as well as the code used to process
  them.  Data is from Neuropixels LFP data from the Allen Brain Institute Visual Behaviour
  and Visual Coding Datasets as well as the International Brain Laboratory Decision
  Making Task Dataset.  SWR start stop times, peak ripple power, and peak power times
  are reported to allow for analysis with spiking and behavioral data in those datasets.
